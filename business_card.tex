% INSERT PERSONAL INFORMATIONS BELLOW: (The order matters! The only fields that can be swapped are the email and phone number)
\vcardfront
	{FirstName LastName}
	{PhD Student}
	{email@host.ac.uk}
	{+44 (0) 1234 123456}
	{QRFirstName} % to card version without QR code leave this field empty
	{QRLastName}
	{QRemail}
	{QRnumber}

% Example:
%\vcardfront
%	{Jo\~{a}o Moura}
%	{PhD Student} % It is possible to change position so to keep a generic card (not just for students)
%	{jmm7@hw.ac.uk} % The position of the e-mail and phone can be swapped according preference
%	{+44 (0) 1234 123456}
%	{Joao} % Without the tilde to be readable by any system
%	{Moura}
%	{jmm7@hw.ac.uk} % The email is replicated so if the email and the phone number fields are swapped it does not change the QR code
%	{+441234123456} % without the parentheses so the phone automatically recognises it as a number
%	{http://www.edinburgh-robotics.org/students/joao-moura} % the personal website only appears in the QR code. In the cards itself there is always the Edinburgh Centre for Robotics website
